# SMART RADIOLOGIST - Covid19 normal xray Diagnoser
## AI based solution for automated radiology.
### Introduction
Bacterial & Viral pathogens are leading cause of Pneumonia. Timely and correct diagnosis is important as pneumonia require immediate attention. Radiography
is an early stage step to identify pneumonia cause. When chest X-rays are interpreted
by a radiologist, he/she can perhaps tell cause of pneumonia. However, rapid interpretation of
X-rays is not possible, due to unavailability of resources in some developing countries,
especially in African Countries.
In this project, I have used a technique Convolutional Neural Networks to automatically detect Pneumonia caused by COVID, Bacteria or Viral from X-ray Images. Deep learning model is embedded in browser application so as to reduce computational cost.
